# Launchpad Overview

This section introduces how the Tribe MemeLaunchpad transforms simple meme ideas into fully tradable tokens. It explains Tribe's mission of making token creation accessible, permissionless, and community‑driven. The overview frames Tribe as a platform that blends on‑chain markets with social engagement, where every meme becomes a Tribe with its own community identity.

## Tribe's Mission

 TRIBE’s mission is to create the most trustworthy environment for meme coin trading, scaling across 
TRUST and major L2s to serve a global community of meme coiners. By 
combining Intuition’s trust infrastructure with L2 scalability, TRIBE delivers a platform where 
traders can invest with confidence, and creators can launch coins without fear of being 
overshadowed by duplicates. Our vision is to legitimize meme coins as a cultural and financial 
phenomenon, bridging the gap between Web3 innovation and internet culture. TRIBE aims to 
onboard 100,000 users in its first year, establish partnerships with leading L2 ecosystems, and 
capture a $100 million share of the meme coin market by 2027. Tribe emphasizes:

- **Accessibility** - No technical expertise required
- **Permissionless** - No gatekeepers or approvals needed
- **Community-Driven** - Every meme becomes a Tribe with its own identity
- **On-Chain Markets** - Transparent, trustless trading
- **Social Engagement** - Built-in community features

## Core Features

The TRIBE MemeLaunchpad enables users to deploy meme tokens instantly with:

### 1. Bonding Curve Pricing

The launchpad uses a **quadratic bonding curve** to determine token prices. This ensures:

- Fair price discovery as supply increases
- No front-running advantages
- Predictable pricing mechanism
- Automatic price adjustment based on supply
- Early-supporter incentives within the Tribe ecosystem

### 2. Automated Liquidity Migration

When the bonding curve reaches its maximum:

- 30% of tokens (held during curve phase) are automatically added to DEX liquidity
- All collected TRUST is used for liquidity pairing
- Liquidity Provider (LP) tokens remain permanently locked in the contract
- Seamless, trustless transition from bonding curve to DEX trading
- Guaranteed safe transition to open-market trading

### 3. Creator-Based Unlock Rules

To prevent rug pulls and ensure creator commitment:

- Tokens start in a **Locked** state
- Creator must purchase **2% of total supply** to unlock trading
- Creator is limited to **maximum 20% of curve supply**
- This ensures creator skin in the game and prevents manipulation

### 4. Social Features

Built-in on-chain social engagement:

- **Comment System** - Users can post on-chain comments (0.025 TRUST fee)
- **Trading Volume Tracking** - Real-time volume metrics
- **Token Metadata** - Name, symbol, image, and creator information stored on-chain
- **Community Identity** - Each meme becomes a Tribe with its own community

### 5. Smart Treasury Fee Routing
